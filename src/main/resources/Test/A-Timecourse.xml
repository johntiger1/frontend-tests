The main purpose of PhenoTips is to capture phenotypic information about patients: symptoms, observations, findings. This information is currently captured as a homogenous set of items, with only a limited way of specifying meta-information about these phenotypes, such as age of onset, severity, or laterality of a symptom, where each meta-information is a standardized category: //childhood// onset (between 1 and 5 years).

Clinicians want to be able to provide more detailed information: a precise age when a symptom appeared, relative ordering between symptoms, or constrain a symptom to just a specific interval, etc.

Design a data model that would be able to capture this information.
